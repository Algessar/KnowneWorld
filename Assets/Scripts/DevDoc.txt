What is important to track; what do players find hard/tedious to calculate? I don't think actual
combat mechanics is too important. Equipment and modifiers might be more pertinent.
Building spells might be most important one. Creating a personalised spell list and getting the full effect
calculated sounds powerful.

* Display total calculated dmg/armour/init/AP modifiers


Naming conventions:

* Intelligence will always be "Intellect". Never Intelligence!

Structures:
* GetComponent in Awake.
* Initialize lists and Dictionaries in Awake.
* Change stats earliest in Start.

TODO:

* Ability system
	* What can a character actually do?
	* Simplest version: A list of descriptions of Actions.

* Equipment system
	* SO ✅
	* Calculate modifiers
* Magic System
	* SO ✅
	* Calculate total damage ✅
* Augmentations
	* Write enum list?
* Archetypes
	* Core Skills
		* Decide Starting values (Noticed Health can get as low as 4)


* General
	* Death Save screen
		* Build logic
		* 
	* Action Points
		* Generate AP
		* Turns
				* Button to Start and End turn.
				* Using AP (Disable skills based on AP available. Button to spend and regain AP (and/or regain on turn))
				* Selecting Abilities, display AP cost etc
				* 
	* Skill point distribution
		* Random generation ✅
		* Manual assignment of base stats and Skill Values
			* Assign rolled values
			* Assign from point pool



* Magic
	* Spell System ✅
	
	* Spell UI
		* Display icons when creating a spell ✅
		* Save spell to Spell Book
			* Use spell from Spell Book 
		* Display number of dice and potential damage

			

NPC's:

* Creating NPCs: Should I just use Character for this? That is probably the simplest, and would make sense. There is no Hero Character 
in the Knowne World; any player is just like anyone else, just distinguished by their feats.



REFACTOR:

Perhaps I should make: 
	* Unit: All base variables.
		* Health
		* AP
		* Atk Pwr
			* Creature : Unit
			* Demon : Unit
			* Character : Unit
				* Archetypes and Core Skills


				class Character : something


				_newCharacter = new Character<>();

	-----------------------------------

	Login and character selection

	Login should be it's own separate Scene. So should Character Selection most likely.

	Scene 1:
		Welcome Screen - Animate something cool?
	Scene 2:
		Login - Input
		login - button
	Scene 3: Player	
		New Character - Button
		Load character - Button
			Select Character - List

		
			As Game Master
				Scene GM
	
		


Dropdown -
Template - definitely matters. Total area to show Options.
Viewport - no visible difference. May be auto sizing
Item - Decides spacing between lines
Item label - Text size etc
Item background - auto sizes what it seems like
Content - also seems to auto size
